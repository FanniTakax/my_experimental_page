There is a separate category for herbal blends and fruit infusions, which are more properly characterized as tisanes. A tisane refers to a caffeine-free blend consisting of herbs, botanicals and/or fruits prepared like a tea, but technically not a tea. If the drink does not have tea leaves from Camellia Sinensis, it is not a tea. It is most likely a tisane. Therefore, it would be an oxymoron to call something an herbal tea because it can only be one or the other.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div id=\"white-tea\" style={props.visibility[1] ? styleDisplay : styleNoDisplay}>\r\n                <p>White tea is comprised of new, young tea leaves and buds from the camellia sinensis plant and is only harvested for a few weeks each spring in the northern district of Fujian, China.

At that time in history, white tea preparation was a very different experience than it is today: early harvest white tea leaves appeared solely in compressed cakes and broken pieces were steeped in earthenware kettles.',\r\n    teaGreen: 'Green tea, also known as unoxidized tea, is made solely from the leaves of the camellia sinensis plant. The leaves are plucked, slightly withered, then immediately cooked to preserve the green quality and prevent oxidization. As a result of these methods, green teas have a much higher concentration of chlorophyll, polyphenols and antioxidants than other tea types. The growing conditions for green tea can be broken down between two different types: sun grown and shade grown. The leaves are generally harvested three times a year with the first flush producing the highest quality leaves. The heating process differs greatly depending on the region and the tea maker’s techniques. Some of the mainstream methods of manufacturing green tea include: Pan Firing - Chinese green teas are often pan or wok roasted to neutralize the natural enzymes then dried, which generally results in a pale green color such as our Dragonwell.',\r\n    teaPuerh: 'Pu-erh tea, known as “black tea” in the Far East part of the world, originates from the Yunnan province of China and is named after the market town in which it was first developed. Pu-erh tea is post-fermented, which means that the tea leaves go through a microbial fermentation process after they have been dried and rolled, causing the leaves to darken and change in flavor. This process allows the teas to not only improve with age like a fine wine, but many pu-erhs are able to retain their freshness for up to fifty years! Pu-erh teas can be found in compressed brick form or in loose leaf form and can be made from both green and black tea leaves.',\r\n    teaOolong: 'Oolong (Wu-lung) tea originates from China and is actually transliterated from two words meaning “black” and “dragon” in English. Besides its inherent meaning, the two words describe the shape of the oolong leaves in their novel state. Oolong tea goes through a unique semi-oxidization process that ranges from 1% - 99%. Shortly after picking, the leaves are withered and semi-oxidized in the sun then shade dried. After this they are basket-tossed to break down the cells on the surface of the leaves and wok fired, which halts the oxidization process. Heating methods include masterfully hand roasting the tea leaves in multiple steps which generally take place throughout the night. Oolongs are often processed over charcoal or wood which gives a unique flavor to the various finishing styles. Finally, the leaves are curled or rolled into crispy shapes that resemble tiny black dragons, hence the descriptive name....',\r\n    teaBlack: 'Black tea, also known as “red tea” in China for its rich, reddish infusion, is unique in that it is comprised from two different forms of the camellia sinensis plant: camellia sinensis sinensis and camellia sinensis assamica. Camellia Sinensis Sinensis yields shorter leaves and is primarily used in China and other neighboring East Asian countries. Camellia Sinensis Assamica has larger leaves and is used in parts of India and Sri Lanka. Dry black tea leaves are 100% oxidized, leaving them with a blackened color, thus earning its namesake. While the method in which it is produced varies from region to region, the process always involves withering, rolling, oxidization and drying. There are two primary methods of processing the leaves before they are graded:',\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport { teTexts }\r\n","import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\r\n\r\nimport Button from './Button'\r\nimport TeasData from '../TeasData'\r\nimport MainDisplayText from './MainDisplayText'\r\nimport { teTexts } from './MainDisplayTextObj'\r\n\r\nconst MainPage = () => {\r\n  const [state, setState] = useState([true, false, false, false, false, false])\r\n\r\n  const handleClick = (index) => {\r\n    let newState = state.map((element, i) => {\r\n        if (i === index) {\r\n          return true\r\n        } else {\r\n          return false\r\n        }\r\n      } \r\n    )\r\n    setState(newState)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    console.log(teTexts)\r\n  }, [])\r\n\r\n// main page navot kiszervezni kulon komponensbe\r\n// routert hasznalni megjelenitesre\r\n// megjelenitendoket kulon objectben tarolni\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"main -page\">\r\n      <h2>Tea 101</h2>\r\n      <Button buttonName={'What is Tea'} onClick={() => handleClick(0, state)} />\r\n      <Button buttonName={'What is White Tea?'}  onClick={() => handleClick(1)} />\r\n      <Button buttonName={'What is Green Tea?'}  onClick={() => handleClick(2)} />\r\n      <Button buttonName={'What is Pu-erh Tea?'}  onClick={() => handleClick(3)} />\r\n      <Button buttonName={'What is Oolong Tea?'}  onClick={() => handleClick(4)} />\r\n      <Button buttonName={'What is Black Tea?'} onClick={() => handleClick(5)} />\r\n      <MainDisplayText visibility={state} />\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default MainPage;","import React from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\n\nimport LandingPage from './components/LandingPage'\nimport MainPage from './components/MainPage'\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <LandingPage />\n      <MainPage />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
